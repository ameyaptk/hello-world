# hello-world

Hi world,

This is my first github readme file. Working my way through the guide as I learn git and github. The commands to create a new README file were:

echo "# hello-world" >> README.md  
git init  
git add README.md  
git commit -m "first commit"  
git remote add origin https://github.com/ameyaptk/hello-world.git  
git push -u origin master
